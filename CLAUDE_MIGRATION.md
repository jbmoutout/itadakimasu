# Claude 4 Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration from Claude 3 models to Claude 4 models in the Itadakimasu application.

## Migration Overview

Based on the [Anthropic Claude Models Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview), this application has been migrated from Claude 3 models to the latest Claude 4 models.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates

All Claude model references have been updated to use the latest Claude 4 Sonnet model:

**Before:**
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

**After:**
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

### 2. Files Updated

The following files were updated with the new model name:

1. **`app/api/weekly-planner/alternatives/route.ts`**
   - Updated model for recipe alternative selection

2. **`app/api/weekly-planner/route.ts`**
   - Updated model for weekly meal planning

3. **`app/api/extract-ingredients/route.ts`**
   - Updated model for ingredient extraction from recipes

4. **`app/api/extract-ingredients/extractor.ts`**
   - Updated model for ingredient extraction utility

5. **`scripts/clean-ingredients.ts`**
   - Updated model for ingredient validation

6. **`scripts/scrape-mangerbouger.ts`**
   - Updated model for ingredient translation

### 3. SDK Update

Updated the Anthropic SDK from version `0.29.0` to `0.55.0` for full Claude 4 compatibility.

## Benefits of Claude 4

According to the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview), Claude 4 models provide:

- **Enhanced Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing
- **200K Context Window**: Increased from previous versions
- **Extended Thinking**: Available on Claude 4 models for complex reasoning tasks
- **Improved Output Quality**: Better overall performance compared to Claude 3 models

## Model Comparison

| Feature | Claude 4 Sonnet | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Claude 3 Sonnet |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Context Window** | 200K | 200K | 200K |
| **Max Output** | 64K tokens | 8K tokens | 4K tokens |
| **Extended Thinking** | Yes | No | No |
| **Training Data Cut-off** | Mar 2025 | Apr 2024 | Aug 2023 |
| **API Model Name** | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 | claude-3-sonnet-20240229 |

## Pricing Impact

The migration to Claude 4 Sonnet maintains the same pricing structure as Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
- **Input Tokens**: $3 / MTok
- **Output Tokens**: $15 / MTok

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, it's recommended to:

1. Test all API endpoints that use Claude models
2. Monitor response quality and performance
3. Verify that the increased max output tokens (64K vs 8K) doesn't cause any issues
4. Check that extended thinking capabilities work as expected

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback to the previous models by reverting the model names to:
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (for most endpoints)
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` (for older compatibility)
